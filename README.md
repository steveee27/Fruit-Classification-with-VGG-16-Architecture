# Fruit-Classification-with-VGG-16-Architecture
This project classifies fruit images into four categories: Acai, Acerola, Apple, and Avocado. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it predicts fruit types with VGG-16. The model is optimized with data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization for better performance and accuracy.
